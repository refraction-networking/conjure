Script to subscribe to the redis Station-to-Detector channel for registered phantoms

sudo apt install python3 pip
pip3 install redis
pip3 install protobuf


./run.sh


DTLS transport is not added yet, so there will be NO registrations for sessions using a DTLS
transport seen printed. I am not sure if it will print an error or not.
