    \caption{\textbf{\scheme Operations}\,---\,\rm%
        A \scheme session is constructed in two pieces. First a client registers by sending a TLS connection
        to the decoy host (see Figure 2c) with a steganographically tagged payload.
        This registration contains the true ``covert'' address that the client would like to connect to and a seed 
        which the \scheme station uses to derive the Phantom IP address for the session (green dashed flow). 
        Second, the client derives the same 
        Phantom IP address and connects directly to it using the proxy protocol (e.g. OSSH) specified in
        the registration (purple dotted flow). The station identifies registered packets by source IP, destination IP,
        and destination port (client IP, phantom IP and port respectively). The traffic is passed 
        to a proxy server handling the specific proxy protocol, which ultimately proxies traffic to
        the covert address.
        Secrets for the individual application proxy service are shared out of band or derived from the secret seed shared
        between client and station during registration, preventing an adversary from 
        successfully connecting to the application in follow up probes.

      An ISP deploys a \scheme station, which sees a passive tap of passing traffic.
      Following a steganographic registration process, a client can connect
      to an unused IP address in the ISP's AS, and the station will
      inject packets to communicate with the client as if there were a proxy server at that address.

        We used iperf to measure the upload bandwidth for a direct connection, TapDance, and \scheme.
        As expected, TapDance's upload performance is several orders of magnitude lower than
        the link capacity, due to the overhead of making frequent reconnects to the decoy site.

        Using iperf, we compare the download performance of a direct connection, TapDance, and \scheme.
        While TapDance can achieve link-capacity download, it still has to occasionally reconnect
        to the decoy, as seen by the periodic dips. These reconnects are more common the more data
        the client sends (e.g. requests or uploads).

        In each case, we have a long-lived session over which requests are being made
        using Apache Benchmark (ab). At the median, \scheme has 44~ms (19\%) faster latency than
        TapDance.
        In addition, TapDance requests are frequently slowed by its intermittent reconnections
        to the decoy, as shown in the longer tail of TapDance's latency CDF. \scheme has no such
        reconnects, and thus has more uniform latency. At the 99th
        percentile, \scheme is 281~ms (92\%) faster than TapDance.

        Censors may be able to distinguish random-looking phantom host IPv6 addresses
        from legitimately used ones based on the address's entropy.
        We used the Entropy/IP tool~\cite{foremski2016entropy} to analyze the entropy
        of 4013 IPv6 addresses observed by our tap. This plot from the tool shows the
        normalized entropy of each nibble in the addresses, which is fairly high
        for most of the non-network prefix nibbles. In total, these addresses have
        about 75~bits of entropy (out of 96 expected), and the relatively high entropy
        present in each nibble would make it difficult for a censor to block without
        significant false positives / negatives. While distinguishable from random
        given enough samples,
        we can also use the Entropy/IP tool to generate addresses from the Bayesian Network

        and compare it to the Binomial distribution (Random) we would expect to see
        if the 96 non-network bits of each address were chosen randomly. In practice,
        we observe much fewer bits set.
        Nonetheless, the significant overlap of these distributions
        would make it difficult for censors to block any individual phantom hosts
        without collateral risk of blocking legitimate services.

        the protocol.
        ``Traffic analysis'' includes latency, inter-packet timing, and website fingerprinting.

    \caption{\textbf{Station Architecture}\,---\,\rm%
        We used PF\_RING to receive packets from a 20~Gbps tap which we load balance
        across 4~CPU cores. The detector processes identify registrations, sending notification to
        all other cores via redis and to the local application 
        via ZMQ when a new registration is received. The detector also
        identifies packets associated with registered flows and diverts them
        to the local application which handles proxying connections. The local 
        application determines which transport the flow should use based on a parameter specified in
        the client's registration and initializes a goroutine to handle forwarding. 
        A censor trying to interfere in this
        connection would need to take over the clients IP address in a precise window (after the 
        registration but before the client connects to the phantom) and correctly guess the phantom host's 
        IP address (or connect to all possible phantom IPs) before the active probe traffic gets to the local application. 
        At this point their connection will fail in a manner specific to the transport that the client specified
        in the registration (e.g. connecting to OSSH without knowledge of the pre-shared secret).}
